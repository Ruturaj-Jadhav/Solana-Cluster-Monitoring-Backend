Project Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Build a real-time on-chain monitoring dashboard for the Solana blockchain that:

●	Detects parent wallets funding 5 or more child wallets within a short time window.
●	Tracks the buy/sell token activity of those child wallets.
●	Polls new Solana transactions every 10–30 seconds.
●	Displays an easy-to-use dashboard with sorting, filtering, and expandable session details.
●	Designed to be extensible for future features like alerts, MEV detection, or market overlays.
●	Timeline: ~2–3 weekends (~1 month) for delivery, aligned with part-time freelance availability (3–6 hours/day on weekends).


Core Requirements
Data Source:

●	Use Helius API for decoded Solana transaction and token swap data (preferred for speed & simplicity over raw RPC).
Backend:

●	Python with FastAPI (for async polling and ecosystem fit).

Polling:

●	Runs every 10–30 seconds to detect:
○	Parent wallets funding ≥5 child wallets within a short, configurable window (e.g. 5 mins).
○	Token swaps (buy/sell) by those child wallets.

Data Tracked:

●	Parent wallet address
●	Total SOL funded to child wallets
●	Tokens involved (bought/sold)
●	Timestamps of funding and swaps
 
●	Time between swaps (e.g. $10 every 1 minute)
●	Estimated time to complete a session

Frontend:

●	Next.js (React) dashboard with:
○	Table view showing parent address, total SOL funded, tokens, status
○	Sorting by total SOL funded (descending)
○	Filtering by token symbol/address
○	Expandable rows with child wallet addresses, SOL received/spent, timestamps
Storage:

●	Store cluster/session data for 7 days (configurable) to manage cost & DB size.
●	Allow CSV export for client analysis.

📊 Bundler Dashboard Column Descriptions
Column	What It Shows
Parent Wallet	The main wallet that is funding multiple other wallets (child wallets).
Token	The token being bought or sold by the child wallets.
Total SOL Funded	The total amount of SOL distributed by the parent wallet to all child wallets.
Fulfilled SOL	How much SOL has already been spent by child wallets on token swaps.
Active / Total Wallets	Number of child wallets that actually performed swaps / total funded wallets.
DEX Used	Which decentralized exchanges (Raydium, Meteora, Phoenix, etc.) were used.
Buy Interval	Average time between each child wallet’s token swap (e.g. 1 min per swap).
Progress	% of Total SOL already used by the bundler session (Fulfilled / Total).
SOL Left 	Amount of SOL still unspent in the session. Indicates how much buying is left.
🕒 Time Remaining	Estimated time left to finish buying all SOL at the current buy rate.
Next Buy ETA	Estimated time when the next child wallet will make a swap.
Health Score	A weighted score (0–100) indicating how strong/promising the bundler session is.
Wallet Tag	Labels if the bundler is a known actor, new wallet, or part of a botnet.
Token Trend	Trend label showing if token price is rising 📈, flat ⚠️, or dropping 📉.
Last Tokens Bought	Tokens that this parent wallet interacted with recently (for tracking patterns).
